from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin

""" setting the url for 'blog/urls' to ^$Â makes the blog/urls the default landing
page for the cupar project and app, because this file is in /cupar/cupar/, ie the 
top level directory. 
"""

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'', include('blog.urls')),

"""
Django will now redirect everything that comes into 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' to blog.urls and look for further instructions there, because of this 2nd entry in urlpatterns.
